	    <h1>Aim:</h1>
	    <p>Around The World In 80 Seconds is an online publication that aims to show people how the internet connects you physically to the rest of the world. The project takes advantage of“traceroute”, a command that is usually used display the route your packets have taken on network as a list.</p>
	    <p>There are currently over 4.33 billion internet users globally, which makes up 56% of the global population. This is an increase from 48% in 2017, and the number is expected to keep rising.  Despite this high usage, many people have a limited knowledge of how the internet works.</p>
	    <p>When creating this project, numerous sites would be browsed and tracked with traceroute in an attempt to have requests travel to as much of the world as possible. Illustrated maps of the paths would be created from this information and published, along with information about the journey (such as the time it took) and the internet in the destination country.</p>

	    <h1>Audience:</h1>
	    <p>The final website is a publication inspired by magazine articles you would see in the likes of Frankie Magazine or Smith Journal. It is designed to be casual, but informative. While the project content is relevant to and can be accessed by anyone, the visual style is driven by femininity and the hope is that the site will be engaging for women.</p>
	    <p>Anecdotally, many of my own female friends have a limited knowledge of the internet and technology, and beyond that are intimidated when learning new things if the topic is tech. In the 1990s women were slower to begin using the internet and while more women were using the internet in the 2000s, the scope of use was not as broad, and there is still an under-representation of women in the tech industry today.</p>
	    <p>From a design perspective, many tech and internet related websites are visually masculine, futuristic or overly professional. This project aims to be distinctly feminine, to help make learning about the internet feel more welcoming to other women.</p>
